# AlgoVista

AlgoVista is an interactive algorithm visualization platform designed to help users understand and explore various computational concepts through dynamic visual representations. The application features three main components: a pathfinding visualizer, Conway's Game of Life, and a sorting algorithm visualizer.

## Features

  - Breadth-First Search
  - Depth-First Search
- Maze generation algorithms
- Interactive grid with wall placement
- Speed control for visualization
- Step-by-step execution option

### 2. Conway's Game of Life
- Interactive cell toggling
- Multiple preset patterns
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Grid size customization
- Start/Stop/Reset controls
- Generation counter

### 3. Sorting Visualizer
- Multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Array size customization
- Speed adjustment
- Sound feedback (optional)
- Step-by-step visualization
